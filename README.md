# Credit_Risk_EDA_and_Data_Preparation
Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering for credit risk analysis; conducted EDA with  visualizations to identify key patterns and delivered actionable insights.
The goal of this project is to analyze a credit risk dataset, perform data cleaning, and explore relationships between features and default risk. The analysis includes univariate, bivariate, and correlation studies to derive actionable insights for credit risk assessment.
âœ… Key Steps Performed
Data Understanding: Inspected dataset shape, missing values, and data types.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled null values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
Feature Engineering: Created new features for better model readiness.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate Analysis: Histograms, boxplots, descriptive statistics.
Bivariate Analysis: Correlation matrix, heatmaps, pair plots.
Relationship between independent variables and target variable.
Insights & Recommendations: Derived patterns for credit risk prediction.
